# Tactile-Games-And-Puzzles-Eagle-Project
My Eagle Project comprises designing, producing, and delivering tactile activities for the Vista Center for the Blind and Visually Impaired. This repo contains the CAD files and instructions (written and recorded). 

Here are five different game designs, three of which have instructions and recordings. The games with the instructions and recordings were selected by the Vista Center to manufactured (5 of each) and delivered.

All of the models were designed to be tactile, fit within a common ~8-10" printbed, and require nearly no supports.

Best of luck!
